  <New file>


* File: >> ldapshrc <<
  Changes:
      Added the PORT setting to the ads() function.
      With the previous version, when I called ads() after
      calling unixldap(), I connected to the port 636 without
      SSL...


* File: >> ldapsh <<
  New functionalities:
      1) Now we can do options "bundling".
         For exmample: "ls -lr"
      2) Added the id() function
      3) Added the loadrc() function (alias source())
      4) Added a csv() function to print the entries in a CSV format
  Changes:
      1) The list() function had an argument "-d". It has been
         renamed to "-dn"
      2) The one letter dash arguments are now automatically quoted
         in the command line. This is done in a very simple way, and
         it's not really safe.
         Example:
            ls "cn=John -f Kennedy"
         will be replaced by
            ls "cn=John '-f' Kennedy"
         This avoid the tedious: "ls '-l'", that can now be
         written "ls -l"
